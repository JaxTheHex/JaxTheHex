# Hi, I’m Jackie

Senior Product Designer (UX/UI). I focus on design systems, accessibility, and creating clear, scalable UI foundations.

This GitHub is a space for small experiments, prototypes, and hackathon projects, especially around AI-enabled UX, design system tooling, and workflow improvements.

I’m not a software engineer, but I enjoy understanding how things work and collaborating closely with developers.
