👋 Hi, I’m Jackie. I’m a UX/UI Designer who loves creating experiences that are not just functional but also fun and engaging. I’ve been in the design world for about 7 years, and I’m always looking for exciting new challenges.
  
👀 I’m into building design systems and creating interactive, inclusive, and beautiful designs. I love breaking down complex things into simple, enjoyable experiences.

🌱 Right now, I’m focusing on making my designs more accessible and ensuring everyone can have a great experience.

💞️  I’m looking to team up on projects where we can create something amazing together that make a positive impact on people's lives.

⚡ Fun fact:  When I’m not designing, you’ll probably find me traveling, enjoying nature, listening to podcasts, or learning something random (right now, the cello is on the list).
